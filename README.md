# Neurips-fulfilling-formal-specifications-asap-by-model-free-reinforcement-learning

Install Requirements:

gym(for environment build up)\
pytorch(for neural network) \
stable_baseline_3(for training algorithm) \
control(for linear system dynamics simulation) \
scipy(for non-linear system dynamics simulation) 

After install all the requirement packages, all the ipython code can be run with one-click.\
Currently, these are the codes for main results, there are more codes on the way.
